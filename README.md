# Monte-Carlo-simulations
This repo consists of Monte Carlo C++ codes used to run coarse-grained simulations for biopolymers like actin filaments. The buckling response of actin filaments to compression forces is modelled. We measure the transverse amplitude of the filament to differentiate between a buckled and unbuckled filament. Buckled configurations give a bimodal probability distribution for the most probable value of the transverse amplitude.
